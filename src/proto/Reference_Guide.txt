Introduction 

Messages transmitted between Server and Client are in binary format using Google Protocol Buffers 
API. Server uses Big Endian format for binary data. 

 

General structure of messages transmitted back and forth between client and server

Heartbeats 

Heartbeats responses from the server are a way of monitoring the communication link between client 
and server. Upon making a successful login to the Rithmic Infrastructure, clients are expected to send 
at least a heartbeat request (if no other requests are sent) to the server in order to keep the connection 
active. The heartbeat interval is specified in the login response. 

 

If clients don’t subscribe to any updates, nor send any queries, including heartbeats, then over a 
threshold amount of time the server will terminate such connections for not keeping the link active. 

 

Heartbeat requests from clients are not required when the client application is already receiving 
updates or responses from the server within the threshold period. 

Support 

The Rithmic Operations team can be contacted by phone at (877) 408-0008 or by email to 
operations@rithmic.com. Consult your support team for after-hours contact details.

3. Responses From Server 

Response messages from server can be in a single message or it can span 
across multiple messages. Based on the ‘template_id’ received, clients 
should check if the message contains field ‘rq_hndlr_rp_code’, or ‘rp_code’. 

 

A response message can have only one of these fields. Clients should use 
the following logic to determine end of responses in the same sequence. 
First, check for the presence of ‘rq_hndlr_rp_code’ which indicates there 
are more response messages to receive. In the absence of this field, clients 
should check field ‘rp_code’, presence of this field indicates there are NO 
more response messages to receive. 

 

4. Time/Tick Bar Responses From Server 

If the returned bars does not include data for the entire requested 

time period, and/or if the number of returned bars is a round number 

(such as 10000), then it is possible that the request was truncated. One 

can request the missing bars by shifting the time period of the original 

request to cover the truncated data. This truncation can occur when 

large amounts of data are requested.
